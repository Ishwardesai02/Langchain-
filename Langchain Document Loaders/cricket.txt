Beneath the sun’s relentless blaze,
Or twilight's calm and dusky haze,
Upon the field both vast and green,
Plays out a sport, proud and serene.
With bat and ball, the tales unfold,
Of glory chased and courage bold.

From village grounds to Lord’s proud gate,
It echoes through the hands of fate.
The leather ball, red seam so tight,
Spins dreams by day, swings truths by night.
With willow's arc and bowler’s stride,
A nation cheers, a tear is cried.
